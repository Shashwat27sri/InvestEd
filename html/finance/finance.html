          <p>Finance is a term for matters regarding the management, creation, and study of money and investments. It involves the use of credit and debt, securities, and investment to finance current projects using future income flows. Because of this temporal aspect, finance is closely linked to the time value of money, interest rates, and other related topics.
            <br><br>"Finance" is typically broken down into three broad categories: public finance, corporate finance, and personal finance.

            Public finance includes tax systems, government expenditures, budget procedures, stabilization policy and instruments, debt issues, and other government concerns. Corporate finance involves managing assets, liabilities, revenues, and debts for a business. Personal finance defines all financial decisions and activities of an individual or household, including budgeting, insurance, mortgage planning, savings, and retirement planning.

                Beginning to invest at a young age provides significant advantages, as investments have a longer time to grow and benefit from the power of compounding. <br>

              <p>Insurance is a contract, represented by a policy, in which a policyholder receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company. The company pools clients’ risks to make payments more affordable for the insured. Most people have some insurance: for their car, their house, their healthcare, or their life. <br><br>

                Insurance policies hedge against financial losses resulting from accidents, injury, or property damage.

                Creating a budget can help you make confident decisions and enjoy peace of mind. A detailed budget, though, can be complex to manage. For one easy way to plan your spending, you might try using the 50-30-20 rule. <br>

                The 50-30-20 rule splits expenses into just three categories. It also offers recommendations on how much money to use for each. With some basic information, you can get on the road to financial. <br> 
                <br>
                -> Needs: 50% <br>
                About half of your budget should go toward needs. These are expenses that must be met no matter what, like your utility bills. If you can honestly say “I can’t live without it,” you have identified a need. Minimum required payments on a credit card or a loan also belong in this category. <br><br>
                -> Wants: 30% <br>
                You subscribe to a streaming service to watch your favorite show, not because you need the subscription to live. Wants are things you enjoy that you spend money on by choice. <br><br>
                -> Savings: 20% <br>
                The remaining 20% of your budget should go toward the future. You may put money in an emergency fund, or save toward a down payment on a home. Paying down debt beyond the minimum payment amount belongs in this category, too.</p>

                Taxes are an important and largest source of income for the government. The government uses the money collected from taxes for various projects for the development of the nation. The Indian tax system is well structured and has a three-tier federal structure. <br><br>
                The tax structure consists of the central government, state governments, and local municipal bodies. When it comes to taxes, there are two types of taxes in India - Direct and Indirect tax. The direct tax includes income tax, gift tax, capital gain tax, etc while indirect tax includes value-added tax, service tax, goods and services tax, customs duty, etc. <br><br>
                <b style="font-size: 18px;"> Types of Taxes in India </b><br>
                Taxation in India is majorly divided into Central and State Govt taxes with two types of taxes: <br>

                ->Direct Taxes <br>
                ->Indirect Taxes <br><br>

                <b> What is Direct Tax?</b> <br>
                Direct taxes are imposed on corporate entities and individuals. These taxes cannot be transferred to others. For individual taxpayers like you, the most important type of Direct tax is the income tax. This tax is levied during each assessment year (1st April to 31st March). As per the Income Tax Act, 1961, it is mandatory for you to make income tax payments if your annual income is above the minimum exemption limit. You can get tax benefits under various sections of the Act. <br><br>
                <b>What are the Different Types of Direct Tax?</b>
                Direct taxes account for almost 50% of the government’s revenue in India. However, income tax is not the only direct tax. Here are the types of direct taxes applicable in India: <br>
                <br>

                  ->Corporate Tax <br><br>
                </b>
                Income tax applies to any income of an Individual and HUF except capital gains and profits from business and profession. Income tax is calculated as per the applicable slab rates for the Assessment Year.

                The central government announces the slab rates in the annual budget.

                You also have the provision to reduce your taxable income using the tax-saving investments and expenses under section 80C. <br><br><br>
                <b>What is Indirect Tax?</b> <br>
                Indirect taxes are collected majorly by the corporates and businesses providing services and products. Thus, the responsibility to deposit indirect taxes lies with these entities.

                <p>Investors are warned to never put all their eggs (investments) in one basket (security or market), which is the central thesis on which the concept of diversification lies.
                  To achieve a diversified portfolio, look for asset classes that have low or negative correlations so that if one moves down, the other tends to counteract it. <br>
                  ETFs and mutual funds are easy ways to select asset classes that will diversify your portfolio, but one must be aware of hidden costs and trading commissions. <br><br>
                  Diversification is a battle cry for many financial planners, fund managers, and individual investors alike. It is a management strategy that blends different investments in a single portfolio. The idea behind diversification is that a variety of investments will yield a higher return. It also suggests that investors will face lower risk by investing in different vehicles.<br><br>
                  Here are five tips for helping you with diversification: <br>
                  -> Spread the Wealth <br>
                  Equities can be wonderful, but don't put all of your money in one stock or one sector. Consider creating your own virtual mutual fund by investing in a handful of companies you know, trust, and even use in your day-to-day life.

                  But stocks aren't just the only thing to consider. You can also invest in commodities, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and real estate investment trusts (REITs). And don't just stick to your own home base. Think beyond it and go global. This way, you'll spread your risk around, which can lead to bigger rewards. <br><br>
                  -> Keep Building Your Portfolio <br>
                  This approach is used to help smooth out the peaks and valleys created by market volatility. The idea behind this strategy is to cut down your investment risk by investing the same amount of money over a period of time. <br>
                  ->Why Should I Diversify? <br>
                  Diversification helps investors to not "put all of their eggs in one basket." The idea is that if one stock, sector, or asset class slumps, others may rise. This is especially true if the securities or assets held are not closely correlated with one another. Mathematically, diversification reduces the portfolio's overall risk without sacrificing its expected return. <br>
                  -> Risk Measurement <br>
                  A diversified portfolio's risk is measured by its total standard deviation of returns. The larger the standard deviation, the greater its expected riskiness.
